## Introduction

Breast cancer detection and classification are critical tasks in medical image analysis, enabling early diagnosis and improving patient outcomes. This project implements a deep learning model to detect and classify breast cancer from mammogram images using convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures.

## Project Structure

- `Breast Cancer Detection and Classification Final Code.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the detection and classification results.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing the dependencies required to run the project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-detection-classification.git
    cd breast-cancer-detection-classification
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook "Breast Cancer Detection and Classification Final Code.ipynb"
    ```

2. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.
